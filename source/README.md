# Project TI: TO HELP
## An App to helps the Visually Impaired
Around 90% of the 246 million individuals who have vision issues including the estimated 39 million blind people who reside in low-income areas. Nowadays, everyone owns a mobile device, despite the fact that they are expensive. People with visual impairments also benefit from modern technology because it allows them to function more easily and get a sense of their surroundings. Building a device for something like this required a lot of time, knowledge, and also money. So we came up with the idea of creating an app that would help visually impaired people. As the days go by, people at this stage have to accept that adaptation to technology is very important and necessary. There are several blind individuals in the world. This frequently turns into one of the regular issues that blind people encounter when interacting with their surroundings. According to a report, a large number of blind people in Indonesia still lack access to education, frequently as a result of the country's poor technological infrastructure. The main objective of our project is that each blind person can achieve the perception of the environment without the help of other people. To achieve this goal, we created “Blind Assistance”. All it takes is a smartphone with a decent camera. Basically, we offer five main functions: text recognition, color recognition, object recognition, scene recognition, currency recognition.
